# Room

Room is my attempt to make a clone of the **Zoom Video Conferencing** Software. It is has some basic functionalities and is solely made because the fascination of the some of the most popular and optimized software products.

I have only made the web based version of it. Also I intend to bring in some features in the future but as of now it can only do some lite video conferencing.


### If you don't know Zoom

Zoom is a videotelephony proprietary software program developed by Zoom Video Communications. It is widely used to hold meeting and keeps the workflow of many companies efficient even in these difficult times.

It has become a standard for connecting with others face-to-face virtually in both business and personal settings.

It has use cases including video and audio conferencing, webinars, live chats, screen-sharing and other collaborative capabilities.


## What features of does my version have as of now?

- There is video and audio conferencing for a limited number of users (I didn't count how many people can join at once)
- There is a unique and random id for every meeting.
- There is a chatting feature too.
- We can mute and unmute audio and video (Well, this isn't a feature as such but when you have built some thing basic, this becomes a feature)

I chose this project because there are a good amount of features that can implemented with this.

## What features can be implemented?

- Make a password based autentication page.
- Virtual background feature for the video (mostly using techniques like background matting or realtime image segmentation). There can be some filter or background images to choose from.
- Raise hand feature
- Make the UI somewhat appealing and quick because to be honest Zoom's UI isn't its best part
- The window should be resizable automatically and manually so that there can be more emphasis on person speaking
- Make screen share option
- Make a recording feature
- Whiteboard feature
- File sharing capabilites
- And some other fun filters like this one

Because it is really fun when people accidently apply this to their video streams especially in official environments (Well, I also sympathize with them)
